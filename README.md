# RESTUARANT PAGE  
A simple implemenattion of a demo Restuarant Page web app using modern web development practices. 

The entire website is dynamically generated fromt the DOM using JavaScript's ES6 modules and **import/export** statements.
This project uses NPM for it's package management and Webpack for bundling the files.

This project was created to flex my understanding on the concept of using JavaScript's ES6 modules as well as programming for the web using modern web development practices as covered in the **ORGANIZING YOUR JAVASCRIPT CODE** section of the Odin's Project JavaScript Curriculum.
